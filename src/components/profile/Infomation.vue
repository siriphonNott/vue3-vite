  <h3>I'm frontend developer.</h3>
  <p class="text-gray-500 mt-5 text-sm">I am experienced in leveraging Flutter, Vue.js (Vue2 and Vue3), React.js, CodeIgniter, Laravel, and Node.js framework to develop web applications and middlewares, including integration of other APIs for application enhancement. I am ambitious and enjoy working under pressure because of the challenges that drive me forward. In addition, I am always highly receptive and eager to share ideas and skills with my colleagues because I believe that working homogeneously for a common goal is better than being the best alone. Furthermore, I am very determined to succeed, so learning new things is what I always thrive on.</p>
